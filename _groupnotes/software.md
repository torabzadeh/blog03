Here we keep a list of useful software:
* [edrixs](https://nsls-ii.github.io/edrixs/) -- for calculating RIXS.
* [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) -- online tool for writing papers in latex.
* [latexdiff](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Using_Latexdiff_For_Marking_Changes_To_Tex_Documents) -- mark-up differences in latex files.
* [latexmk](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/?lang=en) -- straightforwardly compile latex in full.
* [cpdf](https://community.coherentpdf.com/) -- manipulate pdfs.
* [pdfCropMargins](https://pypi.org/project/pdfCropMargins/) -- crop pdfs.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) -- tool for making reproducible computational environments.
* [WebPlotDigitizer](https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) -- extract data from graphs.
* [diffcalc](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/diffcalc-core) -- calculate Q space i.e. a replacement for spec
* [Optics calculations](https://nanocalc.org/ricalc) -- maybe this will be useful for our pump-probe experiments?

Some not especially well refined, but hopefully useful notes are available on these topics
* [Converting unit cells](https://github.com/mpmdean/converting_unitcells)
* [X-ray speckle contrast](https://github.com/mpmdean/speckle_contrast)
* [X-ray and optical penetration](https://github.com/mpmdean/optical_x-ray_penetration_depths)

title: Telework policy

While the group retains the option to require full on-site work, we recognize the value of flexible work arrangements.

The standard arrangement is below, which is designed to help promote interactions between the group members.

We hope that you find your office a convenient and pleasant place to work, so feel free to use it as much as you wish even on telework days and to ask Mark if there are possibilities to improve your offices such as computer peripherals or chairs. The standard minimum presence will be Tuesday-Thursday during normal working hours. Please notify Mark if there is a substantial time period (>2 hours) where you will be away.

We are open to different arrangements. Please get in contact with Mark if you would like to discuss this.

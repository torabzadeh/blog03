title={Resolving length-scale-dependent transient disorder through an ultrafast phase transition},

abstract={Material functionality can be strongly determined by structure extending only over nanoscale distances. The pair distribution function presents an opportunity for structural studies beyond idealized crystal models and to investigate structure over varying length scales. Applying this method with ultrafast time resolution has the potential to similarly disrupt the study of structural dynamics and phase transitions. Here we demonstrate such a measurement of CuIr2S4 optically pumped from its low-temperature Ir-dimerized phase. Dimers are optically suppressed without spatial correlation, generating a structure whose level of disorder strongly depends on the length scale. The redevelopment of structural ordering over tens of picoseconds is directly tracked over both space and time as a transient state is approached. This measurement demonstrates the crucial role of local structure and disorder in non-equilibrium processes as well as the feasibility of accessing this information with state-of-the-art XFEL facilities.},

abstract={Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have opened new frontiers for realizing novel many-body phenomena. Recently NiPS3 has received intense interest since it hosts an excitonic quasiparticle whose properties appear to be intimately linked to the magnetic state of the lattice. Despite extensive studies, the electronic character, mobility, and magnetic interactions of the exciton remain unresolved. Here we address these issues by measuring NiPS3 with ultra-high energy resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We find that Hund's exchange interactions are primarily responsible for the energy of formation of the exciton. Measuring the dispersion of the Hund's exciton reveals that it propagates in a way that is analogous to a double-magnon. We trace this unique behavior to fundamental similarities between the NiPS3 exciton hopping and spin exchange processes, underlining the unique magnetic characteristics of this novel quasiparticle.},

abstract = {Domain wall structures form spontaneously due to epitaxial misfit during thin film growth. Imaging the dynamics of domains and domain walls at ultrafast timescales can provide fundamental clues to features that impact electrical transport in electronic devices. Recently, deep learning based methods showed promising phase retrieval (PR) performance, allowing intensity-only measurements to be transformed into snapshot real space images. While the Fourier imaging model involves complex-valued quantities, most existing deep learning based methods solve the PR problem with real-valued based models, where the connection between amplitude and phase is ignored. To this end, we involve complex numbers operation in the neural network to preserve the amplitude and phase connection. Therefore, we employ the complex-valued neural network for solving the PR problem and evaluate it on Bragg coherent diffraction data streams collected from an epitaxial La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LSCO) thin film using an X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL). Our proposed complex-valued neural network based approach outperforms the traditional real-valued neural network methods in both supervised and unsupervised learning manner. Phase domains are also observed from the LSCO thin film at an ultrafast timescale using the complex-valued neural network.}

temperatures about 6 times the Néel transition in a site-diluted

strong magnetic response is enabled because the system directly
enters the antiferromagnetically ordered state from the isotropic
disordered state, skipping the intermediate anisotropic stage. The
underlying mechanism is achieved on a pseudospin-half square
lattice realized in the [(SrIrO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1</sub>/(SrTiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] superlattice thin film
that is designed to linearly couple the staggered magnetization to
external magnetic fields by virtue of the rotational symmetry-preserving Dzyaloshinskii−Moriya interaction. Our model analysis
shows that the skipping of the anisotropic regime despite finite anisotropy is due to the enhanced isotropic fluctuations under
moderate dilution.}

Since the proposal of charge order–induced MIT in magnetite Fe3O4 in 1939 by Verwey, the nature of the charge order and its role in the transition have remained elusive. Recently, a trimeron order was found in the low-temperature structure of Fe3O4; however, the expected transition entropy change in forming trimeron is greater than the observed value, which arises a reexamination of the ground state in the high-temperature phase. Here, we use electron diffraction to unveil that a nematic charge order on particular Fe sites emerges in the high-temperature structure of bulk Fe3O4 and that, upon cooling, a competitive intertwining of charge and lattice orders arouses the Verwey transition. Our findings discover an unconventional type of electronic nematicity in correlated materials and offer innovative insights into the transition mechanism in Fe3O4 via the electron-phonon coupling. Verwey transition could be evoked by the emergence of a nematic order interacting with specific phonon modes upon cooling.}}

We use this formalism to calculate both the XAS and RIXS with input from density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+DMFT for the recently studied reduced valence nickelates R4Ni3O8 and RNiO2 (R=rare earth), and these results are then contrasted with those for the cuprate CaCuO2 and the unreduced nickelate R4Ni3O10. In contrast to the unreduced R4Ni3O10, the reduced valence nickelates as well as the cuprate show strong orbital polarization due to the dominance of x2−y2 orbitals for the unoccupied 3d states. We also reproduce two key aspects of a recent RIXS experiment for R4Ni3O8: (i) a charge-transfer feature between 3d and oxygen 2p states whose energy we find to decrease as one goes from RNiO2 to R4Ni3O8 to the cuprate, and (ii) an energy-dependent polarization reversal of the fluorescence line that arises from hybridization of the unoccupied 3z2−r2 states with R 5d states. We end with some implications of our results for the nature of the 3d electrons in reduced valence nickelates.}

  abstract={Although charge density wave (CDW) correlations exist in several families of cuprate superconductors, they exhibit substantial variation in CDW wave vector and correlation length, indicating a key role for CDW-lattice interactions. We investigated this interaction in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> using single-crystal x-ray diffraction to collect a large number of CDW peak intensities and determined the Cu and La/Ba atomic distortions induced by the formation of CDW order. Within the CuO2 planes, the distortions involve a periodic modulation of the Cu-Cu spacing along the direction of the ordering wave vector. The charge ordering within the copper-oxygen layer induces an out-of-plane breathing modulation of the surrounding lanthanum layers, which leads to a related distortion on the adjacent copper-oxygen layer. Our result implies that the CDW-related structural distortions do not remain confined to a single layer but rather propagate an appreciable distance through the crystal. This leads to overlapping structural modulations, in which CuO<sub>2</sub> planes exhibit distortions arising from the orthogonal CDWs in adjacent layers as well as distortions from the CDW within the layer itself. We attribute this striking effect to the weak c-axis charge screening in cuprates and suggest this effect could help couple the CDWs between adjacent planes in the crystal.}

The Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, strongly hybridized with planar O $2p_{\sigma}$, largely shape the spatial charge distribution and lead to Ni site-centered charge order. The $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals play a small, but non-negligible role in the charge order as they hybridize with the rare-earth $5d$ orbitals. Our results reveal that the low-energy physics and ground-state character of these nickelates are more complex than those in cuprates.

  abstract={The Verwey transition in magnetite (Fe3O4) is the prototypical metal-insulator transition and has eluded a comprehensive explanation for decades. A major element of the challenge is the complex interplay between charge order and lattice distortions. Here we use ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) to disentangle the roles of charge order and lattice distortions by tracking the transient structural evolution after charge order is melted via ultrafast photoexcitation. A dual-stage response is observed in which X3, X1, and Δ5−type structural distortions occur on markedly different timescales of 0.7–3.2 ps and longer than 3.2 ps. We propose that these distinct timescales arise because X3−type distortions strongly couple to the trimeron charge order, whereas the Δ5 distortions are more strongly associated with monoclinic to cubic distortions of the overall lattice. Our work aids in clarifying the charge-lattice interplay using UED method and illustrates the disentanglement of the complex phases in magnetite.}

ABSTRACT={Low-valence nickelates—including infinite-layer (IL) and trilayer (TL) compounds—are longstanding candidates for mimicking the high-temperature superconductivity of cuprates. A recent breakthrough in the field came with the discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped IL nickelates. Yet, the degree of similarity between low-valence nickelates and cuprates is the subject of a profound debate for which soft x-ray spectroscopy experiments at the Ni L- and O K-edge provided critical input. In this review, we will discuss the essential elements of the electronic structure of low-valance nickelates revealed by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Furthermore, we will review magnetic excitations observed in the RIXS spectra of IL and TL nickelates, which exhibit characteristics that are partly reminiscent of those of cuprates.}

  abstract ={We investigate an experimental toy-model system of a pseudospin-half square-lattice Hubbard Hamiltonian in
[(SrIrO3)1/(CaTiO3)1] to include both nontrivial complex hopping and moderate electron correlation. While the former induces electronic Berry phases as anticipated from the weak-coupling limit, the latter stabilizes an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator ground state analogous to the strong-coupling limit. Their combined results in the real system are found to be an anomalous Hall effect with a nonmonotonic temperature dependence due to the competition of the antiferromagnetic order and charge excitations in the Mott state, and an exceptionally large Ising anisotropy that is captured as a giant magnon gap beyond the superexchange approach. The unusual phenomena highlight the rich interplay of electronic topology and electron correlation in the intermediate-coupling regime that is largely unexplored and challenging in theoretical modeling.}

  abstract = {Bulk charge density waves are now reported in nearly all high-temperature superconducting cuprates, with the noticeable exception of one particular family: the copper oxychlorides. Here, we used resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal a bulk charge density waves in these materials. Combining resonant inelastic x-ray scattering with nonresonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we investigate the interplay between the lattice excitations and the charge density wave, and evidence the phonon anomalies of the Cu-O bond-stretching mode at the charge density wave wave vector. We propose that such electron-phonon anomalies occur in the presence of dispersive charge excitations emanating from the charge density wave and interacting with the Cu-O bond-stretching phonon. Our results pave the way for future studies, combining both bulk and surface probes, to investigate the static and dynamical properties of the charge density wave in the copper oxychloride family.}

abstract={The manifestation of skyrmions in the Mott-insulator Cu2OSeO3 originates from a delicate balance between magnetic and electronic energy scales. As a result of these intertwined couplings, the two symmetry-inequivalent magnetic ions, Cu-I and Cu-II, bond into a spin S = 1 entangled tetrahedron. However, conceptualizing the unconventional properties of this material and the energy of the competing interactions is a challenging task due to the complexity of this system. Here we combine X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering to uncover the electronic and magnetic excitations of Cu2OSeO3 with site-specificity. We quantify the energies of the 3d crystal-field splitting for both Cu-I and Cu-II, fundamental for optimizing model Hamiltonians. Additionally, we unveil a site-specific magnetic mode, indicating that individual spin character is preserved within the entangled-tetrahedron picture. Our results thus provide experimental constraints for validating theories that describe the interactions of Cu2OSeO3, highlighting the site-selective capabilities of resonant spectroscopies.},

abstract = {Magnetic domains play a fundamental role in physics of magnetism and its technological applications. Dynamics of antiferromagnetic domains is poorly understood, although antiferromagnets are expected to be extensively used in future electronic devices wherein it determines the stability and operational speed. Dynamics of antiferromagnets also features prominently in the studies of topological quantum matter. Real-space imaging of fluctuating antiferromagnetic domains is therefore highly desired but has never been demonstrated. We use coherent x-ray diffraction to obtain videos of fluctuating micrometer-scale antiferromagnetic domains in Ni2MnTeO6 on time scales from 10−1 to 103 s. In the collinear phase, thermally activated domain wall motion is observed in the vicinity of the Néel temperature. Unexpectedly, the fluctuations persist through the full range of the higher-temperature helical phase. These observations illustrate the high potential significance of the dynamic domain imaging in phase transition studies and in magnetic device research. Now, one can see fluctuating antiferromagnetic domains with one’s own eyes, in real space and time.}}

  abstract = {The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar low valence nickelates has ignited a vigorous debate regarding their essential electronic properties: Do these materials have appreciable oxygen charge-transfer character akin to the cuprates, or are they in a distinct Mott-Hubbard regime where oxygen plays a minimal role? Here, we resolve this question using O K-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of the low valence nickelate La4Ni3O8 and a prototypical cuprate La2−xSrxCuO4 (x=0.35). As expected, the cuprate lies deep in the charge-transfer regime of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen (ZSA) scheme. The nickelate, however, is not well described by either limit of the ZSA scheme and is found to be of mixed charge-transfer–Mott-Hubbard character with the Coulomb repulsion U of similar size to the charge-transfer energy Δ. Nevertheless, the transition-metal-oxygen hopping is larger in La4Ni3O8 than in La2−xSrxCuO4, leading to a significant superexchange interaction and an appreciable hole occupation of the ligand O orbitals in La4Ni3O8 despite its larger Δ. Our results clarify the essential characteristics of low valence nickelates and put strong constraints on theoretical interpretations of superconductivity in these materials.}

abstract={Excitonic insulators are usually considered to form via the condensation of a soft charge mode of bound electron-hole pairs. This, however, presumes that the soft exciton is of spin-singlet character. Early theoretical considerations have also predicted a very distinct scenario, in which the condensation of magnetic excitons results in an antiferromagnetic excitonic insulator state. Here we report resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. By isolating the longitudinal component of the spectra, we identify a magnetic mode that is well-defined at the magnetic and structural Brillouin zone centers, but which merges with the electronic continuum in between these high symmetry points and which decays upon heating concurrent with a decrease in the material's resistivity. We show that a bilayer Hubbard model, in which electron-hole pairs are bound by exchange interactions, consistently explains all the electronic and magnetic properties of Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> indicating that this material is a realization of the long-predicted antiferromagnetic excitonic insulator phase.},

  abstract = {In many strongly correlated insulators, antiferromagnetic order competes with exotic and technologically relevant phases, like superconductivity. While control of spin order is critical to stabilize different functional states, elucidating the mechanism of laser-induced demagnetization in complex oxides remains a challenge. It is unknown if the optical pulse can quench magnetization nonthermally or if it instead only acts as a heat source. Here, we use ultrafast, broadband, optical spectroscopy to track the responses of the electronic, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom and their relation to antiferromagnetism in the strongly spin-orbit coupled insulator Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
. We find that magnetization can be rapidly and strongly suppressed on a sub-150 fs timescale. At low excitation fluences, the magnetic recovery is fast; however, the recovery time increases dramatically with the magnitude of demagnetization. At the same time, we show that the lattice, evidenced through the Ag phonon frequencies, appears to remain below TN, suggesting that the system remains nonthermal during the optical modulation of spin order. We suggest that photogenerated spin defects are responsible for the long-lived demagnetized state and discuss its implications for optical control of solids.}

Recent x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy studies have revealed slow dynamics of the spin order (SO) stripes in LSNO. Here, we applied resonant soft x-ray ptychography to map the spatial distribution of the SO stripe domain inhomogeneity in real space. The reconstructed images show the SO domains are spatially anisotropic, in agreement with previous diffraction studies. For the SO stripe domains, it is found that the correlation lengths along different directions are strongly coupled in space. Surprisingly, fluctuations were observed in the real space amplitude signal, rather than the phase or position. We attribute the observed slow dynamics of the stripe domains in LSNO to thermal fluctuations of the SO domain boundaries.}

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the development of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) as a tool for measuring electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. Here, we demonstrate the ability of RIXS to probe the interaction between phonons and specific electronic states both near to, and away from, the Fermi level. We perform carbon K-edge RIXS measurements on graphite, tuning the incident x-ray energy to separately probe the interactions of the π and σ electronic states. Our high-resolution data reveal detailed structure in the multiphonon RIXS features that directly encodes the momentum dependence of the e-ph interaction strength. We develop a Green’s-function method to model this structure, which naturally accounts for the phonon and interaction-strength dispersions, as well as the mixing of phonon momenta in the intermediate state. This model shows that the differences between the spectra can be fully explained by contrasting trends of the e-ph interaction through the Brillouin zone, being concentrated at the Γ and K points for the π states while being significant at all momenta for the σ states. Our results advance the interpretation of phonon excitations in RIXS and extend its applicability as a probe of e-ph interactions to a new range of out-of-equilibrium situations.}

To date, the leading method to address this has been to meticulously survey the full phonon dispersion of the material in order to isolate modes with anomalously large linewidth and temperature-dependence. Here we combine quantitative MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) analysis with Monte Carlo based dynamic diffraction simulation and first-principles calculations to directly unveil the soft, anharmonic lattice distortions of model thermoelectric material SnSe. A small single-crystal sample is photoexcited with ultrafast optical pulses and the soft, anharmonic lattice distortions are isolated using MeV-UED as those associated with long relaxation time and large displacements. We reveal that these modes have interlayer shear strain character, induced mainly by c-axis atomic displacements, resulting in domain formation in the transient state. These findings provide an innovative approach to identify mechanisms for ultralow and anisotropic thermal conductivity and a promising route to optimizing thermoelectric devices.}

We further discover a “critical-threshold ordering” behavior for fluence above approximately 12mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, which we show corresponds to the smallest thermodynamically stable c-axis correlation length needed to maintain long-range quasi-two-dimensional AFM order. We suggest that this behavior arises from the crystalline anisotropy of the magnetic-exchange parameters in Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>, whose strengths are associated with distinctly different timescales. As a result, they play out very differently in the ultrafast recovery processes, compared with the thermal-equilibrium evolution.

At high temperature, we discover interlaced optical phonons intercepting a transverse acoustic phonon between 3 and 7 meV.

We find that transient magnetic fluctuations are trapped throughout the entire Brillouin zone while remaining present beyond the time that is required to restore the original spin network. The results are interpreted in the context of a spin-bottleneck effect, in which the existence of an explicit magnetic decay channel allows for an efficient thermalization of transient spin waves.Although ultrafast manipulation of magnetism holds great promise for new physical phenomena and applications, targeting specific states is held back by our limited understanding of how magnetic correlations evolve on ultrafast timescales. Using ultrafast resonant inelastic X-ray scattering we demonstrate that femtosecond laser pulses can excite transient magnons at large wavevectors in gapped antiferromagnets and that they persist for several picoseconds, which is opposite to what is observed in nearly gapless magnets.

  abstract = {Topological states in quantum materials are defined by bulk wave functions that possess nontrivial topological invariants. While edge modes are widely presented as signatures of nontrivial topology, how bulk wave functions can manifest explicitly topological properties remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (IXS) combined with first principles calculations, we report experimental signatures of chiral wave functions in the bulk phonon spectrum of BaPtGe, which we show to host a previously undiscovered twofold-degenerate quadruple Weyl node. The chirality of the degenerate phononic wave function yields a nontrivial phonon dynamical structure factor, S(Q,ω), along high-symmetry directions, that is in excellent agreement with numerical and model calculations. Our results establish IXS as a powerful tool to uncover topological wave functions, providing a key missing ingredient in the study of topological quantum matter.}

  abstract = {Revealing the predominant driving force behind symmetry breaking in correlated materials is sometimes a formidable task due to the intertwined nature of different degrees of freedom. This is the case for La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>4+δ</sub>, in which coupled incommensurate charge and spin stripes form at low temperatures. Here, we use resonant x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to study the temporal stability and domain memory of the charge and spin stripes in La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>4+δ</sub>. Although spin stripes are more spatially correlated, charge stripes maintain a better temporal stability against temperature change. More intriguingly, charge order shows robust domain memory with thermal cycling up to 250 K, far above the ordering temperature. These results demonstrate the pinning of charge stripes to the lattice and that charge condensation is the predominant factor in the formation of stripe orders in nickelates.}

abstract={The unconventional normal-state properties of the cuprates are often discussed in terms of emergent electronic order that onsets below a putative critical doping of x<sub>c</sub>=0.19. Charge density wave (CDW) correlations represent one such order; however, experimental evidence for such order generally spans a limited range of doping that falls short of the critical value x<sub>c</sub>, leading to questions regarding its essential relevance. Here, we use X-ray diffraction to demonstrate that CDW correlations in La<sub>2−x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> persist up to a doping of at least x=0.21. The correlations show strong changes through the superconducting transition, but no obvious discontinuity through x<sub>c</sub>=0.19, despite changes in Fermi surface topology and electronic transport at this doping. These results demonstrate the interaction between CDWs and superconductivity even in overdoped cuprates and prompt a reconsideration of the role of CDW correlations in the high-temperature cuprate phase diagram.},

A key issue is the magnitude of the magnetic superexchange, which relates to whether cuprate-like high-temperature nickelate superconductivity could be realized. We address this question using Ni L-edge and O K-edge spectroscopy of the reduced d<sup>9-1/3</sup> trilayer nickelates R4Ni3O8 (where R=La, Pr) and associated theoretical modeling. A magnon energy scale of ∼80 meV
 resulting from a nearest-neighbor magnetic exchange of J=69(4) meV is observed, proving that d<sup>9-\delta</sup> nickelates can host a large superexchange. This value, along with that of the Ni-O hybridization estimated from our O K-edge data, implies that trilayer nickelates represent an intermediate case between the infinite-layer nickelates and the cuprates. Layered nickelates thus provide a route to testing the relevance of superexchange to nickelate superconductivity.},

  abstract ={The discovery of charge-density-wave-related effects in the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of cuprates holds the tantalizing promise of clarifying the interactions that stabilize the electronic order. Here, we report a comprehensive resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of La2−xSrxCuO4 finding that chargedensity wave effects persist up to a remarkably high doping level of x=0.21 before disappearing at x = 0.25. The inelastic excitation spectra remain essentially unchanged with doping despite crossing a topological transition in the Fermi surface. This indicates that the spectra contain little or no direct coupling to electronic excitations near the Fermi surface, rather they are dominated by the resonant cross section for phonons and charge-density-wave-induced phonon softening. We interpret our results in terms of a chargedensity wave that is generated by strong correlations and a phonon response that is driven by the chargedensity-wave-induced modification of the lattice.}

The interplay between different order parameters is intricate and often subject to intense debate, as in the case of CDW order and superconductivity. In La<sub>2−x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LBCO), the low-temperature structural domain walls are hypothesized as nanometer-scale pinning sites for the CDWs. Coherent x-ray diffraction techniques have been employed here to visualize the domain structures associated with these symmetry changes directly during phase transition. We have pushed Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) into the cryogenic regime where most phase transitions in quantum materials reside. Utilizing BCDI, we image the structural evolution of LBCO microcrystal samples during the high-temperature tetragonal to low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase transition. Our results show the formation of LTO domains close to the transition temperature and how the domain size decreases with temperature. The number of domains follows the secondary order parameter (or orthorhombic strain) measurement with a critical exponent that is consistent with the three-dimensional universality class.}

We use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to track the doping dependence of the collective charge excitations in electron doped La<sub>2-x</sub>Ce<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LCCO). From the resonant energy dependence and the out-of-plane momentum dependence, the charge excitations are identified as three-dimensional (3D) plasmons, which reflect the nature of the electronic structure and Coulomb repulsion on both short and long lengthscales. With increasing electron doping, the plasmon excitations increase monotonically in energy, a consequence of the electron correlation effect on electron structure near the Fermi surface (FS). Importantly, the plasmon excitations evolve from a broad feature into a well-defined peak with much increased life time, revealing the evolution of the electrons from incoherent states to coherent quasi-particles near the FS. Such evolution marks the reduction of the short-range electronic correlation, and thus the softening of the Mottness of the system with increasing electron doping.}

Its size is particularly large in the high-temperature insulating paramagnetic phase near the N{\'e}el transition. This magnetoresistance originates from a collective charge response to the large longitudinal spin fluctuations under a linear coupling between the external magnetic field and the staggered magnetization enabled by strong spin-orbit interaction.

In the low doping regime, the in-plane carbon G peak hardens and narrows with increasing doping, analogous to the trend seen in graphene doped via the field effect. At high dopings, beyond those accessible by the field effect, the G peak strongly softens and broadens. This is interpreted as a dynamic, nonadiabatic renormalization of the phonon self-energy. At dopings between the light and heavily doped regimes, we find a robust inhomogeneous phase where the potassium coverage is segregated into regions of high and low density. The phonon energies, linewidths, and tunability are notably very similar for one- to four-layer potassium-doped graphene, but significantly different to bulk potassium-doped graphite.},

  abstract={The low-energy phonons of two different graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have been measured as a function of temperature using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). In the case of the non-superconductor BaC<sub>6</sub>, the phonons observed are significantly higher (up to 20%) in energy than those predicted by theory, in contrast to the reasonable agreement found in superconducting CaC<sub>6</sub>. Additional IXS intensity is observed below 15 meV in both BaC<sub>6</sub> and CaC<sub>6</sub>. It has been previously suggested that this additional inelastic intensity may arise from defect or vacancy modes not predicted by theory [d’Astuto et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 104519 (2010)]. Here it is shown that this additional intensity can arise directly from the polycrystalline nature of the available samples. Our results show that future theoretical work is required to understand the relationship between the crystal structure, the phonons, and the superconductivity in GICs.},

The dynamics of the quantum spins in these layers lie at the heart of the mystery of the cuprates. In bulk cuprates such as La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, the presence of a weak coupling between the two-dimensional layers stabilizes a three-dimensional magnetic order up to high temperatures. In a truly two-dimensional system however, thermal spin fluctuations melt long-range order at any finite temperature8. Here, we measure the spin response of isolated layers of La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> that are only one-unit-cell-thick. We show that coherent magnetic excitations, magnons, known from the bulk order, persist even in a single layer of La2CuO4, with no evidence for more complex correlations such as resonating valence bond correlations9,10,11. These magnons are, therefore, well described by spin-wave theory (SWT). On the other hand, we also observe a high-energy magnetic continuum in the isotropic magnetic response that is not well described by two-magnon SWT, or indeed any existing theories.},

The damped spin excitation or “paramagnon” in LBCO 1/8 is then measured as it disperses through the CO wave vector. Within the experimental uncertainty no changes are observed in the paramagnon at that wave vector and the paramagnon seems to be similar to that measured in other cuprates, which have no static CO. Given that the stripe correlation modulates both the charge and spin degrees of freedom, it is likely that subtle changes do occur in the paramagnon due to CO. Consequently, we propose that future RIXS measurements, realized with higher-energy resolution and sensitivity, should be performed to test for these effects.},

These magnons broaden with doping, but they persist with a similar dispersion and comparable intensity all the way to the non-superconducting, heavily overdoped metallic phase. The destruction of HTS with overdoping is therefore caused neither by the general disappearance nor by the overall softening of magnetic excitations.

  journal={Nature Physics},
  abstract={Materials tuned to the neighbourhood of a zero temperature phase transition often show the emergence of novel quantum phenomena. Much of the effort to study these new effects, like the breakdown of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory of metals has been focused in narrow band electronic systems. Ferroelectric crystals provide a very different type of quantum criticality that arises purely from the crystalline lattice. In many cases the ferroelectric phase can be tuned to absolute zero using hydrostatic pressure or chemical or isotopic substitution. Close to such a zero temperature phase transition, the dielectric constant and other quantities change into radically unconventional forms due to the quantum fluctuations of the electrical polarization. The simplest ferroelectrics may form a text-book paradigm of quantum criticality in the solid-state as the difficulties found in metals due to a high density of gapless excitations on the Fermi surface are avoided. We present low temperature high precision data demonstrating these effects in pure single crystals of SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and KTaO<sub>3</sub>. We outline a model for describing the physics of ferroelectrics close to quantum criticality and highlight the expected 1/T2 dependence of the dielectric constant measured over a wide temperature range at low temperatures. In the neighbourhood of the quantum critical point we report the emergence of a small frequency independent peak in the dielectric constant at approximately 2K in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and 3K in KTaO<sub>3</sub> believed to arise from coupling to acoustic phonons. Looking ahead, we suggest that in ferroelectric materials supporting mobile charge carriers, quantum paraelectric fluctuations may mediate new effective electron-electron interactions giving rise to a number of possible states such as superconductivity.},

The transverse shift of the ordering wave vector indicates the presence of rotated charge-stripe ordering, demonstrating that the charge ordering is not pinned to the Cu-O bond direction. On cooling through the superconducting transition, we find an abrupt change in the growth of the charge correlations and a suppression of the charge order parameter indicating competition between the two orderings. Orthorhombic LSCO thus helps bridge the apparent disparities between the behavior previously observed in the tetragonal “214” cuprates and the orthorhombic yttrium and bismuth-based cuprates and thus lends strong support to the idea that there is a common motif to charge order in all cuprate families.},

  abstract={The electronic phase diagram of the weak spin-orbit Mott insulator (Sr<sub>1−x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is determined via an exhaustive experimental study. Upon doping electrons via La substitution, an immediate collapse in resistivity occurs along with a narrow regime of nanoscale phase separation comprised of antiferromag- netic, insulating regions and paramagnetic, metallic puddles persisting until x ≈ 0.04. Continued electron doping results in an abrupt, first-order phase boundary where the Néel state is suppressed and a homogenous, correlated, metallic state appears with an enhanced spin susceptibility and local moments. As the metallic state is stabilized, a weak structural distortion develops and suggests a competing instability with the parent spin-orbit Mott state.},

Instead, O K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that orbital polarization is caused by an anisotropic reconstruction of the oxygen ligand hole states. This provides an explanation for the limited success of theoretical predictions based on tuning orbital energy levels and implies that future theories should focus on anisotropic hybridization as the most effective means to drive large changes in electronic structure and realize novel emergent phenomena.},

    abstract={Measuring how the magnetic correlations evolve in doped Mott insulators has greatly improved our understanding of the pseudogap, non-Fermi liquids and higherature superconductivity. Recently, photo-excitation has been used to induce similarly exotic states transiently. However, the lack of available probes of magnetic correlations in the time domain hinders our understanding of these photo-induced states and how they could be controlled. Here, we implement magnetic resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to directly determine the magnetic dynamics after photo-doping the Mott insulator Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>. We find that the non-equilibrium state, 2 ps after the excitation, exhibits strongly suppressed long-range magnetic order, but hosts photo-carriers that induce strong, non-thermal magnetic correlations. These two-dimensional (2D) in-plane Neel correlations recover within a few picoseconds, whereas the three-dimensional (3D) long-range magnetic order restores on a fluence-dependent timescale of a few hundred picoseconds. The marked difference in these two timescales implies that the dimensionality of magnetic correlations is vital for our understanding of ultrafast magnetic dynamics.},

  abstract={Interfaces between correlated complex oxides are promising avenues to realize new forms of magnetism that arise as a result of charge transfer, proximity effects, and locally broken symmetries. We report on the discovery of a noncollinear magnetic structure in superlattices of the ferromagnetic metallic oxide La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> (LSMO) and the correlated metal LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (LNO). The exchange interaction between LSMO layers is mediated by the intervening LNO, such that the angle between the magnetization of neighboring LSMO layers varies in an oscillatory manner with the thickness of the LNO layer. The magnetic field, temperature, and spacer thickness dependence of the noncollinear structure are inconsistent with the bilinear and biquadratic interactions that are used to model the magnetic structure in conventional metallic multilayers. A model that couples the LSMO layers to a helical spin state within the LNO fits the observed behavior. We propose that the spin-helix results from the interaction between a spatially varying spin susceptibility within the LNO and interfacial charge transfer that creates localized Ni2+ states. Our work suggests a new approach to engineering noncollinear spin textures in metallic oxide heterostructures.},

Although all samples exhibited an insulating ground state with long-range magnetic order, temperature-dependent resistivity measurements showed a stronger insulating behavior in the m=2 and m=3 samples than the m=1 sample which displayed a clear kink at the magnetic transition. This difference indicates that the blocking effect of the excessive SrTiO<sub>3</sub> layer enhances the effective electron-electron correlation and strengthens the Mott phase. The significant reduction of the Néel temperature from 150 K for m=1 to 40 K for m=2 demonstrates that the long-range order stability in the former is boosted by a substantial interlayer exchange coupling. Resonant x-ray magnetic scattering revealed that the interlayer exchange coupling has a switchable sign, depending on the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> layer number m, for maintaining canting-induced weak ferromagnetism. The nearly unaltered transition temperature between the m=2 and the m=3 demonstrated that we have realized a two-dimensional antiferromagnet at finite temperatures with diminishing interlayer exchange coupling.},

In this review we outline a representative set of studies detailing how heterostructures based on Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) iridates can be used to access yet more novel physics. Beginning with a short synopsis of iridate thin film growth, the effects of the heterostructure morphology on the RP iridates including Sr2IrO4 and SrIrO3 are discussed. Example studies explore the effects of epitaxial strain, laser-excitation to access transient states, topological semimetallicity in SrIrO3, 2D magnetism in artificial RP iridates, and interfacial magnetic coupling between iridate and neighboring layers. Taken together, these works show the fantastic potential for controlled engineering of novel quantum phenomena in iridate heterostructures."

Magnetic scattering shows predominately c-axis antiferromagnetic orientation of the magnetic moments for the bilayer, as in Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. However, the magnetic excitation gap, measured by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, is quite different between the two structures, evidencing a significant change in the stability of the competing magnetic phases. In contrast, the single layer iridate hosts a more bulk-like gap. We find these changes are driven by bending of the c-axis Ir-O-Ir bond, which is much weaker in the single layer, and subsequent local environment changes, evidenced through x-ray diffraction and magnetic excitation modeling. Our findings demonstrate how large changes in the magnetic interactions can be tailored and probed in spin-orbit coupled heterostructures by engineering subtle structural modulations.},

Lett. 120, 016401 (2018)], we directly measure the phonon dispersion in parity-breaking FeSi using inelastic x-ray scattering. By comparing the experimental data with theoretical calculations, we make the first observation of double Weyl points in FeSi, which will be an ideal material to explore emerging bosonic excitations and its topologically nontrivial properties.},

Ultrafast photo-excitation of these materials holds great promise for understanding and controlling the properties of these states.

These excitations encode the correlations and interactions that determine the detailed properties of the states generated. After outlining the basic principles and instrumentations of tr-RIXS, we review our first observations of transient antiferromagnetic correlations in quasi two dimensions in a photo-excited Mott insulator and present possible future routes of this fast-developing technique. The increasing number of X-ray free electron laser facilities not only enables tackling long-standing fundamental scientific problems, but also promises to unleash novel inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopies.},

  abstract={The electronic states of many Mott insulators, including iridates, are often conceptualized in terms of localized atomic states such as the famous “J<sub>eff</sub>=1/2 state.” Although orbital hybridization can strongly modify such states and dramatically change the electronic properties of materials, probing this process is highly challenging. In this Letter, we directly detect and quantify the formation of dimer orbitals in an iridate material Ba<sub>5</sub>AlIr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>11</sub> using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Sharp peaks corresponding to the excitations of dimer orbitals are observed and analyzed by a combination of density functional theory calculations and theoretical simulations based on an Ir-Ir cluster model. Such partially delocalized dimer states lead to a redefinition of the angular momentum of the electrons and changes in the magnetic and electronic behaviors of the material. We use this to explain the reduction of the observed magnetic moment with respect to predictions based on atomic states. This study opens new directions to study dimerization in a large family of materials, including solids, heterostructures, molecules, and transient states.},

Combined with the negligible carrier doping into the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> layers, these results indicate that the tuning of the electron-phonon coupling can be effectively decoupled from doping.

Using synchrotron radiation to measure the x-ray linear dichroism of epitaxially strained films of the correlated oxide CaFeO3, we demonstrate that the orbital polarization of the Fe valence electrons is opposite from conventional understanding. Although the energetic ordering of the Fe $$3d$$ orbitals is confirmed by multiplet ligand field theory analysis to be consistent with previously reported strain-induced behavior, we find that the nominally higher energy orbital is more populated than the lower. We ascribe this inverted orbital polarization to an anisotropic bandwidth response to strain in a compound with nearly filled bands. These findings provide an important counterexample to the traditional understanding of strain-induced orbital polarization and reveal a method to engineer otherwise unachievable orbital occupations in correlated oxides.},

Recent breakthroughs in Antiferromagnetic Spintronics brought up novel concepts for electronic device development. Imaging antiferromagnetic domains is of key importance to this field. Unfortunately, some of the basic domain types, such as antiphase domains, cannot be imaged by conventional techniques. Herein, we present a new domain projection imaging technique based on the localization of domain boundaries by resonant magnetic diffraction of coherent X rays. Contrast arises from reduction of the scattered intensity at the domain boundaries due to destructive interference effects. We demonstrate this approach by imaging antiphase domains in a collinear antiferromagnet Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and observe evidence of domain wall interaction with a structural defect. This technique does not involve any numerical algorithms. It is fast, sensitive, produces large-scale images in a single-exposure measurement, and is applicable to a variety of magnetic domain types.},

  abstract={Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a very powerful experimental technique to probe a broad range of intrinsic elementary excitations, for example, from low energy phonons and (bi-)magnons to high energy -, charge-transfer and plasmon excitations in strongly correlated electronic systems. Due to the complexity of the RIXS cross-section and strong core-hole effects, theoretical simulation of the experimental RIXS spectra is still a difficult task which hampers the understanding of RIXS spectra and the development of the RIXS technique. In this paper, we present an open source toolkit (dubbed EDRIXS) to facilitate the simulations of RIXS spectra of strongly correlated materials based on exact diagonalization (ED) of certain model Hamiltonians. The model Hamiltonian can be from a single atom, small cluster or Anderson impurity model, with model parameters from density functional theory plus Wannier90 or dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The spectra of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS are then calculated using Krylov subspace techniques. This toolkit contains highly efficient ED, XAS and RIXS solvers written in modern Fortran 90 language and a convenient Python library used to prepare inputs and set up calculations. We first give a short introduction to RIXS spectroscopy, and then we discuss the implementation details of this toolkit. Finally, we show three examples to demonstrate its usage.},

Here, large changes in metal–oxygen band hybridization, as measured in the oxygen ligand hole density, are induced as a result of interfacing two isovalent correlated oxides. Using resonant X-ray reflectivity, a superlattice of SrFeO<sub>3</sub> and CaFeO<sub>3</sub> is shown to exhibit an electronic character that spatially evolves from strongly O-like in SrFeO3 to strongly Fe-like in CaFeO<sub>3</sub>. This alternating degree of Fe electronic character is correlated with a modulation of an Fe 3d orbital polarization, giving rise to an orbital superstructure. At the SrFeO<sub>3</sub>/CaFeO<sub>3</sub> interfaces, the ligand hole density and orbital polarization reconstruct in a single unit cell of CaFeO<sub>3</sub>, demonstrating how the mismatch in these electronic parameters is accommodated at the interface. These results provide new insight into how the orbital character of electrons is altered by correlated oxide interfaces and lays out a broadly applicable approach for depth-resolving band hybridization.}

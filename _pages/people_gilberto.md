Gilberto worked on nickelate heterostructures during his time in the group. Some notable results include direct measurements of [how heterostructuring modifies orbitals](/publications/#fabbris2016orbital), [dispersive magnons](/publications/#fabbris2017doping) and [magnetic](/publications/#hoffman2016oscillatory) [helix states](/publications/#fabbris2018emergent).

Gilberto was promoted to a staff scientist position at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/profile/gilberto-fabbris) in 2017 where he leads efforts to develop a high-pressure x-ray spectroscopy and diffraction program.

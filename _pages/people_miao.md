Hu Miao's main research area is charge density waves in copper-oxide superconductors. He made the first observation of [precursor CDW correlations with RIXS](/publications/#miao2017high), [temperature induced changes in the CDW wavevector](/publications/#miao2018incommensurate), and [doping independent CDW correlations](/publications/#miao2019incommensurate). He also had the very inventive idea of studying topological effects in phonon band structures resulting in the measurement of [double Weyl phonons](/publications/#miao2018double) and [phonon nodal line structures](/publications/#zhang2019phononic). 

Miao is now a staff scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
